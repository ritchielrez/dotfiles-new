1498164285	Gopherfest 2017 | Lessons Learned from a Context-NATS Integration with Waldemar Quevedo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUIh14avdDY	The Context package has been a popular topic in the Golang community for sometime and as of the Go 1.7 release, it has become a standard Go library. It carries a variety of details across API boundaries and between processes. \n\nNATS is an open-source, high-performance, lightweight cloud native messaging system. Many NATS users working in Go have been using Context alongside NATS, but there has not been an officially-supported Context-NATS integration – that is, until now.\n\nThis talk will discuss what Context is, what observations and lessons Waldemar and his team have learned integrating Context and NATS, and how you use the two together. He'll also provide a quick demo to show the integration.\n\nGopherfest 2017 Playlist → https://goo.gle/3Ee0nQh\nSubscribe to The Go Channel → https://goo.gle/go-subscribe\n\n#GoLang #Gopherfest	plain	yt:video:jUIh14avdDY	The Go Programming Language		
1498164277	Gopherfest 2017 | Upspin with Rob Pike	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENLWEfi0Tkg	Upspin is an experimental project to build a framework for naming and sharing files and other data securely, uniformly, and globally: a global name system of sorts. It is not a file system, but a set of protocols and reference implementations that can be used to join things like file systems and other storage services to the name space.\n\nPerformance is not a primary goal. Uniformity and security are. \n\nPer Rob: Note that this is a project IN Go not ABOUT Go\n\nGopherfest 2017 Playlist → https://goo.gle/3Ee0nQh\nSubscribe to The Go Channel → https://goo.gle/go-subscribe\n\n#GoLang #Gopherfest	plain	yt:video:ENLWEfi0Tkg	The Go Programming Language

From git, to Kafka, to block chains, the use of append-only logs is on the rise.\n\nIn this talk, Matt Ho will cover the benefits of event sourcing and how to get started with it using Go. He'll provide the background of event sourcing along with simple illustration of how event-sourcing might be applied to a domain entity. \n\nHe'll go in-depth on how event sourcing can address challenges posed by transactional integrity, dual writes, and scaling – issues which are increasing in importance given the rise of REST-based microservices.\n\nGopherfest 2017 Playlist → https://goo.gle/3Ee0nQh\nSubscribe to The Go Channel → https://goo.gle/go-subscribe\n\n#GoLang #Gopherfest	plain	yt:video:B-reKkB8L5Q	The Go Programming Language

1486778459	FOSDEM 2017 | High performance and scaling techniques in Golang using Go Assembly	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOpprhr6C9I	In this presentation we present some optimizations we have developed for the Minio object server. To maximize hashing performances for bit-rot protection we have exploited the Go Assembly capabilities to natively optimizing BLAKE2 and SHA2 techniques for both Intel and ARM platforms. In addition we will present a distributed locking package to aid with scaling a single server solution into a multi server solution.\n\nIn this presentation we would like to focus on a couple of developments that we have done for the Minio object server in terms of performance improvements and scaling techniques.\n\nRegarding hashing we have developed Go packages for two hashing algorithms (BLAKE2 and SHA256) that take advantage of the Golang (or Plan9) assembly capabilities. These packages exploit SIMD instructions of Intel and the Cryptography Extensions for the ARM platform. The speed up range from 3 to 4 times (Intel) to 100X (on ARM). Due to the use of Golang assembly there is no need for a C-compiler in order to use these packages (when compiling from scratch). For the Intel platform SSE, AVX, and AVX2 specific version are available and the most performant architecture is automatically chosen.\n\nIn addition we have developed a distributed locking and syncing package for Go. Its main features are: - Simple design for avoiding many tricky edge cases - No need for a master node - Resilient so other nodes are not affected when a node goes down - Drop-in replacement for sync.RWMutex -Automatically reconnect to (restarted) nodes - Limited scalability of up to 16 nodes\n\nWe are successfully using this package for the Distributed version of the Minio Object Server\n\nFOSDEM 2017 Go Devroom Playlist → https://goo.gle/3xK2Vof\nSubscribe to The Go Channel → https://goo.gle/go-subscribe\n\n#GoLang #FOSDEM	plain	yt:video:AOpprhr6C9I	The Go Programming Language
