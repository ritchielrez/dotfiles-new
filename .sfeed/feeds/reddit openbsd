I&#39;m getting the following error when I try to direct it to Ventoy USB.</p> <pre><code>mount: no mount helper program found for ntfs </code></pre> <p>Which filesystems can be mounted by OpenBSD installer during installation? Thanks.</p> <p>(I choose NTFS over FAT just to fit large Windows iso file. I can choose http but it is too slow.)</p> <hr/> <p><em>Update:</em></p> <p>After getting valuable info from comment section, I decided to test with other filesystems since Ventoy allow re-formatting the larger partition after installation.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read OpenBSD can&#39;t write <code>ext4</code> but it can read. So, I tried to use <code>ext4</code>. I even make filesystem without &#39;64bit&#39; option cos&#39; I&#39;ve read that OpenBSD do not support ext4 64bit.</p> <p>As one mentioned in the comments, even if I use a mountable filesystem, the installer might not be able to access <code>install71.img</code>, inside which the file sets are located.</p> <p>But the other problem is that the installer still detect the <code>ext4</code> disk as <code>NFTS</code> disk. I&#39;m not sure what is the problem. I checked the USB on linux with <code>lsblk -f</code> and it shows <code>ext4</code> filesystem.</p> <p>Now I just used <code>dd</code> and installed from bootable USB.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/Nick-6"> /u/Nick-6 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/uqmek0/which_filesystems_can_be_mounted_by_openbsd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/uqmek0/which_filesystems_can_be_mounted_by_openbsd/">[comments]</a></span>	html	t3_uqmek0	/u/Nick-6		openbsd

It did this three times in a row. </p> <p>Never had one freeze on boot before in all the many years of work with OpenBSD. So, I am quite perplexed.

Multiple accounts at this server are able to make calls and video calls over conversations/android client.</p> <p>Today i was testing for the first time audio calls from my OpenBSD 7.1 computer with dino-0.3. </p> <p>Audio recording and video ist working fine in my tests before, but when i try to initiate a call with dino, nothing happens - could&#39;nt get a connection. This happens to multiple accounts (on the same prosody server) and to accounts on complete different servers.</p> <p>Going back to the phone and android-client (conversations), calls are absolutely fine with the same accounts.</p> <p>Just curious and before I&#39;m going deeper into it... has anyone been able to successfully perform an audio/video call via dino 0.3 on OpenBSD?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/tack-pa-forhand"> /u/tack-pa-forhand </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/upp1pd/xmpp_audiovideo_calls_on_openbsd_71_with_dino_03/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/upp1pd/xmpp_audiovideo_calls_on_openbsd_71_with_dino_03/">[comments]</a></span>	html	t3_upp1pd	/u/tack-pa-forhand		openbsd

I am planning to use it as my lab driver in learning c programming. Installed htop and wondered why only 6 CPU&#39;s are running, which I guess its the total number of cpu this processor had, the others are hyperthreads is correct? I haven&#39;t touch my sysctl.conf, its a fresh install. Is OpenBSD only using CPU cores? or do I need to configure something to utilize the whole CPU threads? Anyone could explain or point me to the right direction is much appreciated.
