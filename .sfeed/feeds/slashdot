New Atlas reports: The gel is made up of two main ingredients that are cheap and common -- cellulose, which comes from the cell walls of plants, and konjac gum, a widely used food additive. Those two components work together to make a gel film that can absorb water from the air and then release it on demand, without requiring much energy. First, the porous structure of the gum attracts water to condense out of the air around it. The cellulose meanwhile is designed to respond to a gentle heat by turning hydrophobic, releasing the captured water.\n \nIn tests, the gel film was able to wring an astonishing amount of water out of the air. At a relative humidity of 30 percent, it could produce 13 L (3.4 gal) of water per day per kilogram of gel, and even when the humidity dropped to just 15 percent -- which is low, even for desert air -- it could still produce more than 6 L (1.6 gal) a day per kilogram. [...] And the new gel film's efficiency could be improved even further, the team says, by creating thicker films, absorbent beds, or other array formations of the material. Perhaps most importantly, the material is extremely inexpensive to produce, costing as little as $2 per kilogram. The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Cheap+Gel+Film+Pulls+Buckets+of+Drinking+Water+Per+Day+From+Thin+Air%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3sVMkdT"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F25%2F0038252%2Fcheap-gel-film-pulls-buckets-of-drinking-water-per-day-from-thin-air%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/05/25/0038252/cheap-gel-film-pulls-buckets-of-drinking-water-per-day-from-thin-air?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21387346&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653462000	US Moves Toward Supplying Romania With a Modular, Low-Cost Nuclear Plant	https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/25/007219/us-moves-toward-supplying-romania-with-a-modular-low-cost-nuclear-plant?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	tomhath shares a report from The New York Times: The United States said on Monday that it would supply Romania with a training simulator in preparation for building a new type of nuclear power generating plant in the country. If an agreement on moving ahead with a power station is reached, Romania could become the first country in Europe, and perhaps in the world, to have such a plant, known as a small modular reactor.\n \nThe one in Romania would be built by NuScale Power, a start-up company based in Portland, Ore. The government announced that the plant would be built in Doicesti, at the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant about 55 miles northwest of Bucharest. [...] NuScale's approach to nuclear energy involves constructing relatively small reactors in factories and then assembling groups of them at the actual site for generating power. The aim is to reduce costs as well as the time required for construction. Conventional modern nuclear plants can cost $10 billion or more.\n \nThe plan involves building a power station composed of six of the modular units. The plant would generate 462 megawatts of electricity, making it the size of a medium-size conventional power station. Such a plant might cost around $1.6 billion, according to figures published by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. The hope is to have it operating by the end of the decade.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=US+Moves+Toward+Supplying+Romania+With+a+Modular%2C+Low-Cost+Nuclear+Plant%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3LMFqOm"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F25%2F007219%2Fus-moves-toward-supplying-romania-with-a-modular-low-cost-nuclear-plant%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/25/007219/us-moves-toward-supplying-romania-with-a-modular-low-cost-nuclear-plant?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21387224&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653449400	China Launches an Autonomous Mothership Full of Autonomous Drones	https://slashdot.org/story/22/05/25/0014259/china-launches-an-autonomous-mothership-full-of-autonomous-drones?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from New Atlas: China christened a remarkable new 290-foot ship last week -- the world's first semi-autonomous drone carrier. It'll carry, launch, recover and co-ordinate the actions of more than 50 other autonomous aerial, surface and underwater vehicles. The Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard began construction on the Zhu Hai Yun last July in Guangzhou. According to the South China Morning Post, it's the first carrier of its kind, a self-contained autonomous platform that will roll out with everything necessary to perform a fully integrated operation including drone aircraft, boats and submersibles. [...] Zhu Hai Yun will run on remote control until it's out in the open water, and then its self-driving systems will take over to execute whatever mission it's running.\n \nIt's kitted out with everything it needs to deploy its own boats, subs and aircraft, communicate with them, and run co-ordinated missions, including conducting "task-oriented adaptive networking to achieve three-dimensional views of specific targets," according to the shipbuilding company. The aerial drones can land back on its deck, and it stands ready to retrieve the boats and subs once they've made their rounds. While it's mainly pitched as an ocean research platform, the SCMP also reports that it has "military capability to intercept and expel invasive targets," a capability at the forefront of many autonomous marine projects. "Please note that Beijing went from laying down a new class of ship to christening in less than a year," adds the reader.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=China+Launches+an+Autonomous+Mothership+Full+of+Autonomous+Drones%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3wQ62J5"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F25%2F0014259%2Fchina-launches-an-autonomous-mothership-full-of-autonomous-drones%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/story/22/05/25/0014259/china-launches-an-autonomous-mothership-full-of-autonomous-drones?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21387262&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653444120	Driverless Cars Could Force Other Road Users To Drive More Efficiently	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2359227/driverless-cars-could-force-other-road-users-to-drive-more-efficiently?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	MattSparkes shares a report from New Scientist: The idea that autonomous cars, even in small numbers, can increase fuel efficiency, travel times and safety for all cars on the road will be put to the test on routes around Nashville, Tennessee, later this year. Benedetto Piccoli at Rutgers University, New Jersey, and his colleagues previously used a computer model of a simple circular road with just one lane in each direction, and found that autonomous cars could decrease overall fuel consumption of all traffic by 40 percent, even once adoption of these vehicles had only reached 5 per cent.\n \nThe best-case scenarios from these new models "rarely happen" in the real world, he says, but his team still hopes to reduce fuel consumption of all vehicles on the road during the trial -- not just the driverless cars -- by as much as 10 percent. "If you take just the overall cost of the traffic system in any country, and you reduce that by even 5 percent we are talking about billions of dollars," he says. The researchers have shared their findings in a paper via arXiv.org.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Driverless+Cars+Could+Force+Other+Road+Users+To+Drive+More+Efficiently%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3an04I7"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F2359227%2Fdriverless-cars-could-force-other-road-users-to-drive-more-efficiently%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2359227/driverless-cars-could-force-other-road-users-to-drive-more-efficiently?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21387212&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653441900	Spain To Invest $13 Billion To Build Microchip Industry	https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2145228/spain-to-invest-13-billion-to-build-microchip-industry?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	The Spanish government on Tuesday announced plans to invest $13.2 billion to build microchips in the country and "help reduce the dependence of Span and the European Union on other suppliers," reports the Associated Press. From the report: Speaking in Madrid, Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said the five-year plan is aimed at enabling Spain to cover every area in the design and production of microchips, which are now considered key to all areas of modern industry. She said the plan was among the most ambitious of the Spanish government's projects to reboot the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and that it would have an effect on other sectors.\n \nThe project was directed at boosting the EU's weak position in microchip production, which Calvino said represented some 10% of the world total. She said this led to a great dependence on a small number of major producers such as Taiwan, the United States, South Korea, Japan and China. Calvino added that "the war in Ukraine makes it a priority to reinforce strategic autonomy in energy, technology, food production as well as cyber security."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Spain+To+Invest+%2413+Billion+To+Build+Microchip+Industry%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3sUHptF"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F2145228%2Fspain-to-invest-13-billion-to-build-microchip-industry%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2145228/spain-to-invest-13-billion-to-build-microchip-industry?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386926&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653439500	Samsung Allegedly Assembling a 'Dream Team' To Take Down Apple's M1 In 2025	https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2132208/samsung-allegedly-assembling-a-dream-team-to-take-down-apples-m1-in-2025?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Samsung is rumored to be assembling a special task force dubbed "Dream Platform One team" tasked with designing a custom in-house Samsung mobile Application Processor (AP) that can take on Apple Silicon. Neowin reports: It's probably fair to say that Samsung hasn't had the best time with its Exynos offerings when compared against rivals like Qualcomm or Apple. To shake its fortunes up, the company also paired up with AMD for its Exynos 2200 GPU, and results were a mixed bag. Both the AMD RDNA 2 Xclipse 920 graphics and the Exynos 2200 CPU were found to be pretty disappointing in terms of power efficiency as they were not much better than the previous Exynos 2100 offering. In a nutshell, the new CPU was around 5% faster while the AMD graphics was around 17% better, both of which were clearly not enough (via TechAltar on Twitter). However, the company is looking to get real serious and down to business come 2025. The new report coincides with a separate report suggesting that Samsung was working on a custom chipset for its Galaxy S series. The downside is that it's not slated for 2025 and will obviously have to compete against whatever Apple offers at that time.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Samsung+Allegedly+Assembling+a+'Dream+Team'+To+Take+Down+Apple's+M1+In+2025%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3LDQPjG"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F2132208%2Fsamsung-allegedly-assembling-a-dream-team-to-take-down-apples-m1-in-2025%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2132208/samsung-allegedly-assembling-a-dream-team-to-take-down-apples-m1-in-2025?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386892&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD

Sedar Soares was shot dead in 2003 while throwing snowballs with friends in the parking lot of a Rotterdam metro station. The 13-year-old's murder baffled police for years. Now, with the permission of Sedar's family, they have made a video in which the teen asks the public to help solve the cold-case crime.\n \nIn what Dutch police believe could be a world first, an eerily lifelike image of Sedar appears in the video as he greets the camera and picks up a football. Accompanied by stirring music, he walks through a guard of honor on the field, comprising his relatives, former teachers and friends. "Somebody must know who murdered my darling brother. That's why he has been brought back to life for this film," a voice says, before Sedar stops and drops his ball. "Do you know more? Then speak," Sedar and his relatives and friends say, before his image disappears from the field and the video gives the police contact details. Dutch police have posted the deepfake video on YouTube. You can also watch the making of the video in the documentary "Speak!

"Due to a confidential search agreement, the DuckDuckGo browser does not block all Microsoft trackers," reports Review Geek. "What's worse, DuckDuckGo only acknowledged this 'privacy hole' after it was discovered by a security researcher." From the report: Security researcher @thezedwards found that the mobile DuckDuckGo browser does not block Microsoft trackers on third-party websites, such as the Facebook-owned Workplace.com. Gabriel Weinberg, the CEO of DuckDuckGo, is now running damage control on Twitter. He explains that Microsoft cannot see what you search in DuckDuckGo, and the DuckDuckGo browser blocks all Microsoft cookies. But if you visit a website that contains Microsoft's trackers, then your data is exposed to services like Bing and LinkedIn. This is the result of DuckDuckGo's "search syndication agreement" with Microsoft. In order to pull search information from Bing, the privacy experts at DuckDuckGo have to poke holes in their browser's security system.\n \nWhile DuckDuckGo has a solid privacy policy when it comes to Microsoft's ads, it hasn't explained how Microsoft uses data from third-party trackers. And that's quite alarming. Maybe this situation is overblown, or maybe Microsoft can build targeted ad profiles based on your web activity in DuckDuckGo -- we don't know because DuckDuckGo signed a confidentiality agreement. Gabriel Weinberg says that DuckDuckGo is "working tirelessly behind the scenes" to improve its deal with Microsoft. Additionally, he expects DuckDuckGo to "include more third-party Microsoft protection" in a future update.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Bing+Contract+Prohibits+DuckDuckGo+From+Completely+Blocking+Microsoft+Tracking%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3wSAt2F"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F218210%2Fbing-contract-prohibits-duckduckgo-from-completely-blocking-microsoft-tracking%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/218210/bing-contract-prohibits-duckduckgo-from-completely-blocking-microsoft-tracking?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386828&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653432000	Facebook Opens Political Ad Data Vaults To Researchers	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/210259/facebook-opens-political-ad-data-vaults-to-researchers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	Meta's ad transparency tools will soon reveal another treasure trove of data: advertiser targeting choices for political, election-related, and social issue spots. The Register reports: Meta said it plans to add the targeting data into its Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT) environment for academic researchers at the end of May. The move comes a day after Meta's reputation as a bad data custodian resurfaced with news of a lawsuit filed in Washington DC against CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Yesterday's filing alleges Zuckerberg built a company culture of mishandling data, leading directly to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The suit seeks to hold Zuckerberg responsible for the incident, which saw millions of users' data harvested and used to influence the 2020 US presidential election.\n \nJeff King, Meta's VP of business integrity, said that FORT would allow researchers to look at detailed targeting information for social issue, electoral and political ads. "This data will be provided for each individual ad and will include information like the interest categories chosen by advertisers," King said. Prior to this announcement, data for social, electoral, and political ads in the run-up to the 2020 election was available as part of a pilot program. This new release will expand the pilot and add data from all ads in those categories run globally since 2020, King said.\n \nThe non-academic public has to wait until July to get their hands on that data in Facebook's Ad Library, and when released it will be in a summarized form. Included in the update will be data on total number of social, electoral, and political ads ran on a page using particular targeting data, percentage spent on the different issues, and whether the page uses a custom or lookalike audience. King said that Meta hopes the release will "help people better understand the practices used to reach potential voters on our technologies," and emphasized yet again that Meta is "committed to providing meaningful transparency, while also protecting people's privacy."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Facebook+Opens+Political+Ad+Data+Vaults+To+Researchers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F39ReSP1"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F210259%2Ffacebook-opens-political-ad-data-vaults-to-researchers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/210259/facebook-opens-political-ad-data-vaults-to-researchers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386816&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		BeauHD		
1653429720	Someone Stole Seth Green's Bored Ape, Which Was Supposed To Star In His New Show	https://slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/2057212/someone-stole-seth-greens-bored-ape-which-was-supposed-to-star-in-his-new-show?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader quotes a report from BuzzFeed News: Actor and producer Seth Green was robbed of several NFTs this month after succumbing to a phishing scam that inadvertently threw a monkey wrench into the plan for his new animated series. The forthcoming show was developed from characters in Green's expansive NFT collection, but in light of the recent hack, the project's blatant crypto optimism has become a tragically ironic reminder of the industry's shadier side. On Saturday, Green teased a trailer for White Horse Tavern at the NFT conference VeeCon. A twee comedy, the show seems to be based on the question, "What if your friendly neighborhood bartender was Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398?" In an interview with entrepreneur and crypto hype man Gary Vaynerchuk, Green said he wanted to imagine a universe where "it doesn't matter what you look like, what only matters is your attitude."\n \nUnfortunately for Green, what also matters is copyright law. And when the actor's NFT collection was pilfered by a scammer in early May, he lost the commercial rights to his show's cartoon protagonist, a scruffy Bored Ape named Fred Simian, whose likeness and usage rights now belong to someone else. "I bought that ape in July 2021, and have spent the last several months developing and exploiting the IP to make it into the star of this show," Green told Vaynerchuk. "Then days before -- his name is Fred by the way -- days before he's set to make his world debut, he's literally kidnapped." Green did not respond to a tweet from BuzzFeed News regarding the show.\n \nOn May 8, an anonymous scammer swiped four of Green's NFTs in a phishing scheme. Green mourned his "stolen" assets on Twitter, where he announced the losses of a Bored Ape, two Mutant Apes, and a Doodle, which were transferred out of Green's wallet after he unknowingly interacted with a phishing site. One of the Mutant Apes was flipped for $42,000, Motherboard reported. Transaction ledgers show the Bored Ape was also sold by the scammer to a pseudonymous collector known as "DarkWing84," who purchased it for more than $200,000. The NFT was then swiftly transferred to a collection called "GBE_Vault," which is where it currently sits. If the current owner "wanted to cause trouble for Seth Green they probably could, because that person becomes the holder" of the commercial usage rights, said Daniel Dubin, an intellectual property attorney at Alston &amp; Bird LLP. [...] Seemingly aware of the problems his ape's new owner could cause, Green has spent the last several days tweeting at DarkWing84 in an attempt to reclaim the Bored Ape [...].

1653427500	Watching Less TV Could Cut Heart Disease, Study Finds	https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1947248/watching-less-tv-could-cut-heart-disease-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	More than one in 10 cases of coronary heart disease could be prevented if people reduced their TV viewing to less than an hour a day, research suggests. From a report: Coronary heart disease occurs when fatty material builds up inside the coronary arteries causing them to narrow, reducing the heart's blood supply. Researchers say cutting down on time spent in front of the TV could lower the risk of developing the disease. "Reducing time spent watching TV should be recognised as a key behavioural target for prevention of coronary heart disease, irrespective of genetic susceptibility and traditional risk markers," said Dr Youngwon Kim, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong and an author of the research. \n\nWhile the team did not look at what was behind the association, Kim said previous studies had found excessive TV viewing time is associated with adverse levels of cholesterol and glucose in the body. "Unfavourable levels of these cardiometabolic risk markers may then lead to increased risk of developing coronary heart disease," he said. Writing in the journal BMC Medicine, Kim and colleagues report how they used data from 373,026 white British people aged 40-69 who were part of an endeavour known as the UK Biobank study.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Watching+Less+TV+Could+Cut+Heart+Disease%2C+Study+Finds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3yR2aKu"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F1947248%2Fwatching-less-tv-could-cut-heart-disease-study-finds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1947248/watching-less-tv-could-cut-heart-disease-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386610&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1653425040	Shards of the Planet Mercury May Be Hiding on Earth	https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1941253/shards-of-the-planet-mercury-may-be-hiding-on-earth?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	New research explains how meteorites called aubrites may actually be shattered pieces of the planet closest to the sun from the early days of the solar system. From a report: Mercury does not make sense. It is a bizarre hunk of rock with a composition that is unlike its neighboring rocky planets. "It's way too dense," said David Rothery, a planetary scientist at the Open University in England. Most of the planet, the closest to the sun, is taken up by its core. It lacks a thick mantle like Earth has, and no one is quite sure why. One possibility is that the planet used to be much bigger -- perhaps twice its current bulk or more. Billions of years ago, this fledgling proto-Mercury, or super Mercury, could have been hit by a large object, stripping away its outer layers and leaving the remnant we see behind. \n\nWhile a nice idea, there has never been direct evidence for it. But some researchers think they have found something. In work presented [PDF] at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston in March, Camille Cartier, a planetary scientist at the University of Lorraine in France, and colleagues said pieces of this proto-Mercury may be hiding in museums and other meteorite collections. Studying them could unlock the planet's mysteries. "We don't have any samples of Mercury" at the moment, said Dr. Cartier. Gaining such specimens "would be a small revolution" in understanding the natural history of the solar system's smallest planet. According to the Meteoritical Society, nearly 70,000 meteorites have been gathered around the world from places as remote as the Sahara and Antarctica, finding their way into museums and other collections. Most are from asteroids ejected from the belt between Mars and Jupiter, while more than 500 come from the moon. More than 300 are from Mars.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Shards+of+the+Planet+Mercury+May+Be+Hiding+on+Earth%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3GdCNnC"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F1941253%2Fshards-of-the-planet-mercury-may-be-hiding-on-earth%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1941253/shards-of-the-planet-mercury-may-be-hiding-on-earth?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386596&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1653422700	Amazon Employees Are Quitting at Twice the Rate of Recent Years	https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1923207/amazon-employees-are-quitting-at-twice-the-rate-of-recent-years?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	A growing number of employees Amazon doesn't want to lose are leaving the company, according to a report. Insider: An internally tracked metric, called "regretted" attrition, has reached an average of 12.1% since June 2021, more than double the average in recent years, according to internal data obtained by Insider. That number had hovered around 5% from 2016 to mid-2021, the data shows. Regretted attrition is the portion of employees Amazon didn't want to see leave, typically through voluntary departures. Separately, Amazon closely follows another metric called "unregretted" attrition, which represents employees it's not afraid to lose, as Insider previously reported. [...] The spike in Amazon's regretted attrition is one of the many fallouts of rising inflation, as wage inflation and competition for talent make it easier for the company's most prized corporate employees to find better opportunities elsewhere. Amazon employees who previously spoke to Insider said the company's relatively low pay, stagnant stock price, and grueling work culture have all contributed to the growing departure rate.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Amazon+Employees+Are+Quitting+at+Twice+the+Rate+of+Recent+Years%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3lLmzIV"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F1923207%2Famazon-employees-are-quitting-at-twice-the-rate-of-recent-years%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1923207/amazon-employees-are-quitting-at-twice-the-rate-of-recent-years?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386518&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1653420300	Apple Shipped Me a 79-Pound iPhone Repair Kit To Fix a 1.1-Ounce Battery	https://apple.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1912220/apple-shipped-me-a-79-pound-iphone-repair-kit-to-fix-a-11-ounce-battery?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	An anonymous reader shares a report: Last month, Apple launched its Self-Service Repair program, letting US customers fix broken screens, batteries, and cameras on the latest iPhones using Apple's own parts and tools for the first time ever. I couldn't wait. I'd never successfully repaired a phone. This time, armed with an official repair manual and genuine parts, I'd make it right. That Apple would even let me buy those parts, much less read its manuals and rent its tools, is a major change of pace for the company. For years, Apple has been lobbying to suppress right-to-repair policies around the country, with the company accused of doing everything it can to keep customers from repairing their own phones. It's easy to see this as a huge moment for DIY advocates. But having tried the repair process, I actually can't recommend it at all -- and I have a sneaking suspicion that Apple likes it that way. \n\nThe thing you should understand about Apple's home repair process is that it's a far cry from traditional DIY if you opt for the kit -- which I did, once I saw the repair manual only contains instructions for Apple's own tools. (You can just buy a battery if you want.) I expected Apple would send me a small box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers; I own a mini iPhone, after all. Instead, I found two giant Pelican cases -- 79 pounds of tools -- on my front porch. I couldn't believe just how big and heavy they were considering Apple's paying to ship them both ways. I lugged those cases onto a BART train to San Francisco and dragged them down the streets to our office. Then, I set everything out on a table and got started.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Apple+Shipped+Me+a+79-Pound+iPhone+Repair+Kit+To+Fix+a+1.1-Ounce+Battery%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3yQNMBY"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F1912220%2Fapple-shipped-me-a-79-pound-iphone-repair-kit-to-fix-a-11-ounce-battery%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1912220/apple-shipped-me-a-79-pound-iphone-repair-kit-to-fix-a-11-ounce-battery?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386458&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash		
1653417720	Climate Worries Galvanize a New Pro-Nuclear Movement in the US	https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1838254/climate-worries-galvanize-a-new-pro-nuclear-movement-in-the-us?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed	As states race to keep plants open, California becomes a test case of how much the tide has shifted. From a report: Charles Komanoff was for decades an expert witness for groups working against nuclear plants, delivering blistering critiques so effective that he earned a spot at the podium when tens of thousands of protesters descended on Washington in 1979 over the Three Mile Island meltdown. Komanoff would go on to become an unrelenting adversary of Diablo Canyon, the hulking 37-year-old nuclear facility perched on a pristine stretch of California's Central Coast that had been the focal point of anti-nuclear activism in America. But his last letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in February, was one Komanoff never expected to write. He implored Newsom to scrap state plans to close the coastal plant. "We're going to have to give up some of our long-held beliefs if we are going to deal with climate," Komanoff said in an interview. "I am still a solar and wind optimist. But I am a climate pessimist. The climate is losing." \n\nKomanoff's conversion is emblematic of the rapidly shifting politics of nuclear energy. The long controversial power source is gaining backers amid worries that shutting U.S. plants, which emit almost no emissions, makes little sense as governments race to end their dependence on fossil fuels and the war in Ukraine heightens worries about energy security and costs. The momentum is driven in large part by longtime nuclear skeptics who remain unsettled by the technology but are now pushing to keep existing reactors running as they face increasingly alarming news about the climate. \n\nThe latest report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in April, warned that the world is so dangerously behind on climate action that within a decade it could blow past the targets crucial to containing warming to a manageable level. Emissions analysts are increasingly critical of retirements of existing nuclear reactors as they take large amounts of low-emissions power off the grid, undermining the gains made as sources such as wind and solar come online. The movement to keep plants open comes despite persistent worries about toxic waste and just a decade after the nuclear disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant. It has been boosted by growing public acceptance of nuclear power and has nurtured an unlikely coalition of industry players, erstwhile anti-nukers, and legions of young grass-roots environmental activists more worried about climate change than nuclear accidents.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Climate+Worries+Galvanize+a+New+Pro-Nuclear+Movement+in+the+US%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3wG4D8W"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png"></a>\n<a class="slashpop" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F22%2F05%2F24%2F1838254%2Fclimate-worries-galvanize-a-new-pro-nuclear-movement-in-the-us%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook"><img src="https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/05/24/1838254/climate-worries-galvanize-a-new-pro-nuclear-movement-in-the-us?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=21386350&amp;smallembed=1" style="height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>	html		msmash
